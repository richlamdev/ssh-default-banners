# Contributing

All kinds of contributions are welcome!

- Incorrect OS version or SSH banner?
- Wrong documentation?  Confusing instructions?
- Any other suggestions for improvement? Better wording? Typos? Dead links?

Please report _anything_ that seems wrong to you by
[creating an issue](https://github.com/richlamdev/ssh-default-banners/issues) for it.

If you feel like fixing it yourself, open a
[pull request](https://help.github.com/categories/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests).

Thank you for contributing!
